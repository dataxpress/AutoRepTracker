# AutoRepTracker

Automatically change your tracked reputation based on what zone you're in.

## Currently Supported Zones & Factions

- Alliance cities
- Alliance Battlegrounds
- Plaguelands, Scholo, Strat -&gt; Argent Dawn
- Silithus -&gt; Cenarion Hold
- Molten Core -&gt; Hydraxian Waterlords
- Felwood, Winterspring -&gt; Timbermaw Hold

More zones & factions are coming soon, along with support for Horde.

Currently AutoRepTracker is aimed at Classic, but there's no reason it shouldn't work with Retail as well.
